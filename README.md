# monty-dragon-hall-simulation

This is a modification of the Dragon Realm guessing game found in "Invent Your Own Computer
Games with Python" by Al Sweigart. I've modified it to be a simulator for the Monty Hall
Problem from probability theory. I first learned about the problem in Leonard Mlodinow's book
"The Drunkard's Walk" which served as my textbook when I taught a capstone psychology course
at Fairmont State University. The original program is commented out at the end of this file.
